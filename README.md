# BlackjackServer

This server allows client side connections to play in a round robin blackjack table where each player plays one hand at a time with the ability to Bet, Hit and Stay. Players are removed when they run out of money. Messaging was built in however, remains untested as the client did not support the functionality. The server and client use a protocol which was designed as part of the assignment by the class. The client is currently not available here as I am working on getting permission for the executable or the code.
